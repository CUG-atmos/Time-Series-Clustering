# Time-Series-Clustering

Time series clustering is to partition time series data into groups based on similarity or distance, so that time series in the same cluster are similar. The term "similar" is linked to the data type and the specific objective function we will apply.

Time series clustering belongs to the unsupervised learning methods and it can be divided in different parts:

- Distance and similarity/dissimilarity
  - Shape-based
    - Lock-step
      - Euclidean
      - Manhattan
      - Minkowski
      - Mahalanobis
      - Correlation
        - Pearson
        - Spearman
        - Kendall tau
      - Cross-Correlation
      - Dissim
     - Elastic measure
      - Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
      - Frechet distance
      - Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS)
  - Features-based
    - Partial/Autocorrelation
    - Fourier
    - Wavelet
    - Periodogram
    - SAX
    - Spectral Density
  - Structure-based
    - Model
      - Cepstral
    - Compression
      - Compression
      - Complexity invariant
      - Permutation distribution based distance
