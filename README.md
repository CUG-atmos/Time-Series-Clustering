# Time-Series-Clustering

Time series clustering is to partition time series data into groups based on similarity or distance, so that time series in the same cluster are similar. The term "similar" is linked to the data type and the specific objective function we will apply.

Time series clustering belongs to the unsupervised learning methods and it can be divided in different parts:

- Distance and dissimilarity
  - Shape-based
  - Features-based
  - sructure-based
    
- clustering methods
  - Partitioning methods
  - Hierarchical clustering
  - Fuzzy clustering
  - Density-based clustering
  - Model-based clustering
 
 - cluster validity measures
  - Global 
  - Local
  - Internal
  - External
